  This repository is an implementation of the VirusTotal agent.

  ## Getting Started
  To perform your first scan, simply run the following command.
  ```shell
  ostorlab scan run --install --agent agent/ostorlab/virustotal file malware.exe
  ```

  This command will download and install `agent/ostorlab/virustotal` and targets the file `malware.exe`.
  For more information, please refer to the [Ostorlab Documentation](https://github.com/Ostorlab/ostorlab/blob/main/README.md)


  ## Usage

  Agent VirusTotal can be installed directly from the ostorlab agent store or built from this repository.

   ### Install directly from ostorlab agent store

   ```shell
   ostorlab agent install agent/ostorlab/virustotal
   ```

  You can then run the agent with the following command:
  ```shell
  ostorlab scan run --agent agent/ostorlab/virustotal file malware.exe
  ```


  ### Build directly from the repository

   1. To build the virustotal agent you need to have [ostorlab](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) installed in your machine.  if you have already installed ostorlab, you can skip this step.

  ```shell
  pip3 install ostorlab
  ```

   2. Clone this repository.

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Ostorlab/agent_virus_total.git && cd agent_virus_total
  ```

   3. Build the agent image using ostorlab cli.

   ```shell
   ostorlab agent build --file=ostorlab.yaml
   ```
   You can pass the optional flag `--organization` to specify your organisation. The organization is empty by default.

   4. Run the agent using one of the following commands:
     * If you did not specify an organization when building the image:
        ```shell
        ostorlab scan run --agent agent//virustotal file malware.exe
        ```
     * If you specified an organization when building the image:
        ```shell
        ostorlab scan run --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/virustotal file malware.exe
        ```
